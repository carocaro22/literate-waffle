# Research Project 1
This is an assignment of the first semester of my Masters in Networked Systems. 

The Project wants to access different Modulation Techniques for Embedded Systems. More specifically, I want to investigate what alternatives to the LoRa Modulation exists or are being currently researched. 

The first Modulation Technique I am interested is M-ary Aggregate Spread Spektrum Pulse Modulation presented in following papers: 

[1] Nikitin, A. V., & Davidchack, R. L. (2020). Pulsed waveforms and intermittently nonlinear filtering in synthesis of low-SNR and covert communications. IEEE Access, 8, 173250-173266.  
[2] Nikitin, A. V., & Davidchack, R. L. (2021, December). M-ary aggregate spread pulse modulation in LPWANs for IoT applications. In 2021 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) (pp. 01-07). IEEE.
