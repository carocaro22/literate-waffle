# Research Project 1
This is an assignment of the first semester of my Masters in Networked Systems. 

The Project wants to access different Modulation Techniques for Embedded Systems. More specifically, I want to investigate what alternatives to the LoRa Modulation exists or are being currently researched. 

The first Modulation Technique I am interested is M-ary Aggregate Spread Spektrum Pulse Modulation presented in following papers: 

[M-ary Aggregate Spread Pulse Modulation in LPWANs for IoT applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9595771)
