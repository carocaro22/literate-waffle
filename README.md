# Research Project
This is an assignment of the first semester of my Masters in Networked Systems. 

The Research is about Modulation Techniques for Embedded Systems. More specifically, I want to investigate what alternatives to the LoRa Modulation exists or are being researched. 

In this very beggining of the research I am just trying to make sense of following paper about the M-ary Aggregate Spreak Pulse Modulation written by Alexei Nikitin and Ruslan L. Davidchak

[M-ary Aggregate Spread Pulse Modulation in LPWANs for IoT applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9595771)
